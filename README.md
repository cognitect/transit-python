transit-python
==============

Transit is a format and set of libraries for conveying values between
applications written in different programming languages. The library provides
support for marshalling data to/from Python.

 * [Rationale](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit)
 * [API docs](http://cognitect.github.io/transit-python/)
  * [Mirrored for PyPI](http://pythonhosted.org/transit-python/)
 * [Specification](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)

This implementation's major.minor version number corresponds to the
version of the Transit specification it supports.

_NOTE: Transit is intended primarily as a wire protocol for transferring data between applications. If storing Transit data durably, readers and writers are expected to use the same version of Transit and you are responsible for migrating/transforming/re-storing that data when and if the transit format changes._

## Releases and Dependency Information

The [PYPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) package is
[`transit-python`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transit-python)

 * Latest stable release: [0.8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transit-python)

You can install with any of the following:

 * `easy_install transit-python`
 * `pip install --use-wheel --pre transit-python`

You can uninstall with:

 * `pip uninstall transit-python`

## Usage

```python
# io can be any Python file descriptor,
# like you would typically use with JSON's load/dump

from transit.writer import Writer
from transit.reader import Reader

writer = Writer(io, "json") # or "json-verbose", "msgpack"
writer.write(value)

reader = Reader("json") # or "msgpack"
val = reader.read(io)
```

For example:

```
>>> from transit.writer import Writer
>>> from transit.reader import Reader
>>> from StringIO import StringIO
>>> io = StringIO()
>>> writer = Writer(io, "json")
>>> writer.write(["abc", 1234567890])
>>> s = io.getvalue()
>>> reader = Reader()
>>> vals = reader.read(StringIO(s))
```


## Supported Python versions

 * 2.7.X
 * 3.5.X


## Type Mapping

### Typed arrays, lists, and chars

The [transit spec](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)
defines several semantic types that map to more general types in Python:

* typed arrays (ints, longs, doubles, floats, bools) map to Python Tuples
* lists map to Python Tuples
* chars map to Strings/Unicode

When the reader encounters an of these (e.g. <code>{"ints" =>
[1,2,3]}</code>) it delivers just the appropriate object to the app
(e.g. <code>(1,2,3)</code>).

Use a TaggedValue to write these out if it will benefit a consuming
app e.g.:

```python
writer.write(TaggedValue("ints", [1,2,3]))
```

### Python's bool and int

In Python, bools are subclasses of int (that is, `True` is actually `1`).

```python
>>> hash(1)
1
>>> hash(True)
1
>>> True == 1
True
```

This becomes problematic when decoding a map that contains bool and
int keys.  The bool keys may be overridden (ie: you'll only see the int key),
and the value will be one of any possible bool/int keyed value.

```python
>>> {1: "Hello", True: "World"}
{1: 'World'}
```

To counter this problem, the latest version of Transit Python introduces a
Boolean type with singleton (by convention of use) instances of "true" and
"false." A Boolean can be converted to a native Python bool with bool(x) where
x is the "true" or "false" instance. Logical evaluation works correctly with
Booleans (that is, they override the __nonzero__ method and correctly evaluate
as true and false in simple logical evaluation), but uses of a Boolean as an
integer will fail.

### Default type mapping

|Transit type|Write accepts|Read returns|
|------------|-------------|------------|
|null|None|None|
|string|unicode, str|unicode|
|boolean|bool|bool|
|integer|int|int|
|decimal|float|float|
|keyword|transit\_types.Keyword|transit\_types.Keyword|
|symbol|transit\_types.Symbol|transit\_types.Symbol|
|big decimal|float|float|
|big integer|long|long|
|time|long, int, datetime|datetime|
|uri|transit\_types.URI|transit\_types.URI|
|uuid|uuid.UUID|uuid.UUID|
|char|transit\_types.TaggedValue|unicode|
|array|list, tuple|tuple|
|list|list, tuple|tuple|
|set|set|set|
|map|dict|dict|
|bytes|transit\_types.TaggedValue|tuple|
|shorts|transit\_types.TaggedValue|tuple|
|ints|transit\_types.TaggedValue|tuple|
|longs|transit\_types.TaggedValue|tuple|
|floats|transit\_types.TaggedValue|tuple|
|doubles|transit\_types.TaggedValue|tuple|
|chars|transit\_types.TaggedValue|tuple|
|bools|transit\_types.TaggedValue|tuple|
|link|transit\_types.Link|transit\_types.Link|


## Development

### Setup

Transit Python requires [Transit](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-format) to be at the same directory level as
transit-python for access to the exemplar files. You will also need
to add transit-python to your PYTHONPATH.

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```

Tests should be run from the transit-python directory.

### Benchmarks

```sh
python tests/seattle_benchmark.py
```

### Running the examples

```sh
python tests/exemplars_test.py
```

### Build

```sh
pip install -e .
```

The version number is automatically incremented based on the number of commits.
The command below shows what version number will be applied.

```sh
bin/revision
```


## Contributing

This library is open source, developed internally by Cognitect. We welcome discussions of potential problems and enhancement suggestions on the [transit-format mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/transit-format). Issues can be filed using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-python/issues) for this project. Because transit is incorporated into products and client projects, we prefer to do development internally and are not accepting pull requests or patches.
